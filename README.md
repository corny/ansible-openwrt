Ansible OpenWRT
===============

Ansible repository to maintain the configuration of OpenWRT devices.
You only need Lua (no Python!) on the remote devices.

Features
--------

* Set hostname and location
* Modify txpower and channels
* Retrieve UCI values
* Enable PoE passthrough during boot on TP-Link CPE210/CPE520 devices
* Manual firmware upgrades (dangerous!)
